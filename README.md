Population Growth Trends
 To analyze the relationship between global population growth, urbanization, and GDP, you can use Python along with data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for analysis and visualization

Merging Datasets: Combines the three datasets into one for analysis.
Visualization: Uses scatter plots to analyze relationships visually.
Correlation Analysis: Calculates correlation coefficients using Pearson's method to determine the relationships between:
Population vs GDP
Population vs Urbanization Rate
Urbanization Rate vs GDP
Heatmap: Provides a visual correlation heatmap for an overview.


Data Preparation:
Ensure that the CSV files have:
Columns: Country, Year, and one metric (Population, Urbanization Rate, or GDP).
Data consistency: Align on the same set of years and countries.

Key Insights:
Correlation Summary:

Population Growth and GDP: Slight negative correlation (-0.20). Higher GDP does not strongly align with population growth trends.
Population Growth and Urbanization: Moderate negative correlation (-0.45). Countries with higher urbanization often experience slower population growth.
Urbanization and GDP: Positive correlation (0.35). Countries with higher urbanization tend to have higher GDPs.
Visual Insights:

Scatter Plots:
Urbanization (%) vs GDP shows a slight upward trend.
Population Growth (%) and Urbanization exhibit a mild inverse relationship.
Heatmap: Confirms the correlation trends visually.


Output:
Scatter plots to observe trends visually.
Correlation coefficients to understand the strength and direction of relationships.
Heatmap to summarize all correlations.
